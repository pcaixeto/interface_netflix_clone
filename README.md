# interface_netflix_clone
Interface Netflix clone with books as a template. 
Made with the help of Carrefour Web Developer Bootcamp.

This interface represents the first page of Netflix, with the buttons "Ouvir Agora" and "Mais informações" leading the user to a Youtube Video and a wikipage, respectively.

The other books in the carousel don't show in the background yet, just the "1984" in the background.
